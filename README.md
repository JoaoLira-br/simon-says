# 319 project - Simon Says

Our project is a HTML/JS hybrid application with two modes: pattern memorization and typing. In the pattern memorization mode, a pattern will flash across 4 differently colored tiles, and the user must input the correct sequence. In the typing game, the user has to type the word that is currently on the screen. Each mode has its own set of high scores that the user can access at anytime.
To run, download the files, and run the server using 'node server.js' in a terminal within the JS folder. Then, open the Home page file located in the HTML folder.
